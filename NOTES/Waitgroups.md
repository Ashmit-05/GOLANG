In Go, a WaitGroup is a synchronization primitive provided by the `sync` package that allows you to wait for a group of goroutines to finish their execution before proceeding. It provides a way to coordinate the execution of multiple goroutines.

Here's how the WaitGroup works:

1. Create a WaitGroup: To use a WaitGroup, you need to create an instance of it using the `sync.WaitGroup` struct.

2. Add goroutines to the WaitGroup: Before starting a goroutine, you call the `Add` method of the WaitGroup and specify the number of goroutines to add. This indicates that you expect a specific number of goroutines to complete before proceeding.

3. Goroutine execution: Each goroutine that you start should call the `Done` method of the WaitGroup when it finishes its execution. This tells the WaitGroup that the goroutine has completed its task.

4. Wait for goroutines to finish: After adding goroutines to the WaitGroup, you call the `Wait` method, which blocks the execution of the current goroutine until all goroutines in the WaitGroup have called `Done`. Once all goroutines are done, the `Wait` method unblocks, and your program can continue executing.

Here's a simple example to illustrate the usage of a WaitGroup:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

func worker(id int, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	defer wg.Done() // Notify WaitGroup when this goroutine is done

	fmt.Printf("Worker %d starting\n", id)
	// Perform some work
	fmt.Printf("Worker %d done\n", id)
}

func main() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	// Add three goroutines to the WaitGroup
	wg.Add(3)

	// Start three workers
	for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
		go worker(i, &wg)
	}

	// Wait for all workers to finish
	wg.Wait()

	fmt.Println("All workers have completed")
}
```

In this example, we create a WaitGroup `wg` and add three goroutines to it using `wg.Add(3)`. Each worker goroutine calls `wg.Done()` when it completes its work. Finally, we call `wg.Wait()` to block the main goroutine until all workers have finished. The output of this program will show the workers starting, completing their work, and the "All workers have completed" message at the end.

WaitGroups are a convenient way to synchronize and coordinate the execution of multiple goroutines, ensuring that they have all completed before proceeding with the next steps in your program.
