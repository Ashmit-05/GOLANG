Arrays are not used much in Go because of their fixed length. If you have declared an array and given it an inital size of 4, then, if you try to print the length of the array, it will always show 4, irrespective of how many elements are present in the array.

## Declaration
```
var <VariableName>[<length>]
```

## len()
Gives the length of the array
