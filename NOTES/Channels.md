Channels are a way in which your multiple [[Goroutines]] can talk to each other.

In Go, channels are a powerful mechanism for communication and synchronization between [[Goroutines]]. A channel is like a pipeline that allows [[Goroutines]] to send and receive values. It provides a safe and efficient way for [[Goroutines]] to exchange data, ensuring proper coordination and synchronization.

Channels have two fundamental operations: sending and receiving data. The sending operation is denoted by the `<-` operator with the channel on the left side, while the receiving operation is denoted by the `<-` operator with the channel on the right side.

Channels can be created with the `make` function, specifying the type of data that will be passed through the channel. Here's an example:

go

`ch := make(chan int) // Creates an unbuffered channel of integers`

Channels can be used to pass data between [[Goroutines]]. When a goroutine sends a value through a channel, it waits until another goroutine receives the value. This communication happens synchronously, meaning the sender and receiver [[Goroutines]] are coordinated.
