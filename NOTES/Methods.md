When using functions inside classes, we like to term them as methods. Since Go doesn't have classes. We use them with stucts
## Declaration
```
func (<variable name> <Struct Name>) <Function Name> {
// something
}
```

**Note:- Whenever we pass a struct to the method, we are passing it by value. Hence any changes made to the struct inside the method won't reflect back in the actual struct**
