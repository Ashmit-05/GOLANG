A deadlock occurs when two or more [[Goroutines]] are waiting for each other to release resources indefinitely. In other words, none of the [[Goroutines]] can proceed because they are stuck in a state of waiting, leading to a program that hangs or becomes unresponsive.

One common scenario for a deadlock is when there is a circular dependency between [[Goroutines]] and the resources they need. For example, consider two [[Goroutines]], Goroutine A and Goroutine B. Goroutine A holds Resource X and waits for Resource Y, while Goroutine B holds Resource Y and waits for Resource X. As a result, both [[Goroutines]] are waiting for resources that are held by the other, causing a deadlock.

Here's an example that illustrates a potential deadlock scenario:
```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    ch := make(chan int)

    go func() {
        value := <-ch // Goroutine A waiting to receive data from the channel
        fmt.Println("Received:", value)
    }()

    ch <- 42 // Goroutine B trying to send data to the channel

    // This line will never be reached because Goroutine A is waiting for data from the channel, causing a deadlock
    fmt.Println("Sent data")
}

```

In the above code, we have a goroutine that is waiting to receive data from the channel, and the main goroutine is trying to send data to the channel. However, since the receiving goroutine is not yet ready to receive, a deadlock occurs, and the program hangs.

To prevent deadlocks, it's important to carefully manage the coordination and synchronization between [[Goroutines]]. You can use techniques such as proper channel usage, avoiding circular dependencies, using timeouts or cancellation signals, and using synchronization primitives like `sync.WaitGroup` or `sync.Mutex` to coordinate resource access.
