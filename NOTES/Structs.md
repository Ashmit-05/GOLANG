A structure or struct in Golang is a user-defined type that allows to group/combine items of possibly different types into a single type. Any real-world entity which has some set of properties/fields can be represented as a struct. This concept is generally compared with the classes in object-oriented programming.
```
 type Address struct {
      name string 
      street string
      city string
      state string
      Pincode int
}
```
